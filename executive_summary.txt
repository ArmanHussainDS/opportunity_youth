This report comprises a large collection of data collectively acquired through SQL and effectively visualized through Pandas to convey and communicate the data obtained from Opportunity Youth (OY) between the ages of 16 and 24 in the city of Seattle but within the South King County area. The key factors which aided the data analysis included but were not limited to: the age, employment status, zip code data, and current enrollment at school. The findings clearly distinguish the the parts of King County within South King County. The analysis found an overall decrease in Opportunity Youth between the years 2016 and 2018. Based on the data analysed, the recommendation would be to invest more greatly in cities within South King County to ensure higher participation of the Opportunity Youth Program.
